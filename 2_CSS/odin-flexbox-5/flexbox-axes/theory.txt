Q: How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?
A: flex-direction: column;

Q: In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
A: The item's height.

Q: In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?
A: The item's width.

Q: Why do the previous two questions have different answers?
A: Because the main axis switches: width is the "long" side in a row, height is the "long" side in a column.

Q/A: Why do boxes collapse sometimes?
If you use flex: 1 (instead of 1 1 auto) and the direction is column, items might collapse.

Why? Because flex: 1 sets flex-basis: 0, so their starting height is zero and only grows if the parent has a set height.

Fixes:

Use flex: 1 1 auto; so they start at their defined height/content.

Give the container a set height.

Or use only flex-grow: 1.
