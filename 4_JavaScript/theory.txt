Q: What is JS?
A: JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you 
to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling 
video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard 
web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in 
other parts of the Learning Area.

- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, 
control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
(Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)

Q: Name the eight data types in JavaScript.
A: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Object, Symbol, BigInt

Q: Which data type is NOT primitive?
A: Object

Q: What is the relationship between null and undefined?
A: Both represent “no value”, but undefined usually means a variable was declared but not assigned, while null is an assigned absence of value (intentional empty value).

Q: What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?
A: All can make strings, but only backticks (`text`) allow embedding variables or expressions using ${...} and multi-line strings without escape characters.

Q: What is the term for joining strings together?
A: Concatenation

Q: Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?
A: Backtick quotes (template literals: `...`)

Q: How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?
A: Use a template literal and place the value inside ${...}:
let name = "Odin";
let str = `Hello, ${name}!`;
// 'Hello, Odin!'

8. How do you use escape characters in a string?

Prefix the special character with \ (backslash):

Example: 'It\'s cold.' or "He said \"hi\"."

9. What is the difference between the slice and substring string methods?

Both extract parts of a string, but slice lets you use negative indexes (counts from the end), while substring treats negative indexes as zero.

10. What are the three logical operators, and what do they stand for?

&& (AND)

|| (OR)

! (NOT)

11. What are the comparison operators?

==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=

12. What are truthy and falsy values?

Any value used in a boolean context is either truthy (will be treated as true in an if/else) or falsy (treated as false).

13. What are the falsy values in JavaScript?

false, 0, -0, 0n (BigInt zero), "" (empty string), null, undefined, and NaN.

14. What are conditionals?

Statements that allow code to make choices based on whether a condition is true or false (e.g. if, else, switch).

15. What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?

js
if (condition) {
  // code if true
} else {
  // code if false
}
16. What is the syntax for a switch statement?

js
switch(expression) {
  case value1:
    // code
    break;
  case value2:
    // code
    break;
  default:
    // code
}
17. What is the syntax for a ternary operator?

js
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
18. What is nesting?

Putting one structure inside another—such as an if inside another if, or a loop inside a loop.
