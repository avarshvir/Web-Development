Q: What is JS?
A: JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on 
web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you 
to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling 
video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard 
web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in 
other parts of the Learning Area.


- JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, 
control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else. 
(Okay, not everything, but it is amazing what you can achieve with a few lines of JavaScript code.)
